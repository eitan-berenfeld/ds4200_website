<p>DJing and electronic dance music production are my greatest passions. I’m drawn to the way music can transform a moment, bringing people together and creating energy that’s electric and unforgettable. Artists like Knock2, Porter Robinson, and It's Murph are major inspirations for me, not only because of their unique sounds but also because of the emotional depth and innovation they bring to their music. Knock2’s high-energy beats, Porter Robinson’s ethereal, emotive storytelling, and It’s Murph’s infectious grooves have all influenced my style and approach to both DJing and production.
When I DJ, I’m focused on creating an experience for the audience—curating a journey through music that keeps people moving and engaged. It’s about reading the crowd, feeling the vibe, and adjusting the set to match the energy in the room. Production allows me to dive deeper into my creativity, experimenting with new sounds, rhythms, and structures. I love the technical side of production, from sound design to mixing, but also the freedom to express my personal style through music.
Ultimately, DJing and producing offer me a unique way to connect with others through sound, allowing me to blend creativity with my passion for electronic music.</p>
